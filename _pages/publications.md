  **The Dark Side of Adding a Category: Will Existing Ones "Pay the Price"**, with Ron Berman and Eric T. Bradlow

  ‘More is better’ has been a belief held by many retailers when they manage product assortments. We challenge this conventional wisdom by demonstrating that a retailer may face more price sensitive demand for existing products when expanding its assortments. To measure the effects of assortment expansion on price sensitivity, we exploit the state of Washington’s privatization of liquor sales in 2012 that generated exogenous variation in retailers’ assortments over time. We find that customers are on average more price sensitive when purchasing from other drink categories after a store started to carry liquor. To understand the differential changes in the price sensitivity across product categories depending on whether they are complements or substitutes to the new product category, we build a demand model that simultaneously estimates the degree of complementarity between product categories and the changes in price sensitivity upon assortment expansion. We find that the increase in the price sensitivity happens mostly in the categories that are complements to the new one, and that these changes cannot be rationalized by alternative explanations, e.g., correlated preferences across product categories and changes in error variances. Based on the demand estimates, we conduct counterfactual simulations and show that the observed prices are consistent with retailers’ (biased) belief that the price sensitivity does not vary with assortment, which results in significant profit loss.

[**The Impact of Subscription Programs on Customer Purchases**](https://www.dropbox.com/s/cghi5izjd1u1fac/Subscriptions%2020200130.pdf?dl=0), with Raghuram Iyengar and Young-Hoon Park

Subscription programs are increasingly popular among a wide variety of retailers. These types of programs give members access to a set of exclusive benefits for a fixed fee upfront. In this paper, we examine the causal effect of adopting a subscription program on subsequent customer behavior using a unique panel data of customers’ purchasing record before and after their adoption of a subscription program. To account for self-selection and identify the individual-level treatment effects, we combine a difference-in-differences approach with a generalized random forest that matches each member of the program with comparable non-members. We find the subscription leads to a large increase in customer purchases. The effect is economically significant, persistent over time, and heterogeneous across customers. Interestingly, only one-third of the effect on customer purchases is due to the economic benefits of the subscription program and the remaining is attributed to becoming a member per se. We provide evidence that members experience a sunk cost fallacy due to the upfront payment that subscription programs entail. We discuss the implications of our findings for customer retention and subscription services.
